# Goal
- I want to simulate card counting of heads-up black jack game in the casinos

# m1c
- Instead of pausing a fixed amount of time, let's narrate (using speech synthesis with a British guy) and then move on to the next action
  - When moving from the "Deal" action, utter "You are dealt $x and $y, which sums up to $z." 

# m1b
- Display all possible score if there are > 0 aces

# m1a
- Create index.html
- Make a black jack game with 1 dealer and 1 player
- Use 2 decks of cards and only reset back to 2 decks when the shoe is 75% used
- Start with $200 for the player
- Implement all the standard black jack rules and provide buttons or inputs for bet amount, hit, stand, double down, and split when applicable
- Use Hi-Lo card counting strategy to display the running count and true count and the recommended bet size.
